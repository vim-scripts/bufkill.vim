" bufkill.vim
" Maintainer:	John Orr (john undersc0re orr yah00 c0m)
" Version:	1.11
" Last Change:	10 December 2012

" Introduction: {{{1
" Basic Usage:
" When you want to unload/delete/wipe a buffer, use:
"   :bun/:bd/:bw to close the window as well (vim command), or
"   :BUN/:BD/:BW to leave the window intact (this script).
" To move backwards/forwards through recently accessed buffers, use:
"   :BB/:BF
" To move to the alternate buffer whilst preserving cursor column, use:
"   :BA
" or override Ctrl-^ via g:BufKillOverrideCtrlCaret
" Mappings are also defined when g:BufKillEnableMappings is not set to 0.

" Description:
" This is a script to
" a) unload, delete or wipe a buffer without closing the window it was displayed in
" b) in its place, display the buffer most recently used in the window, prior
"    to the buffer being killed.  This selection is taken from the full list of
"    buffers ever displayed in the particular window.
" c) allow one level of undo in case you kill a buffer then change your mind
" d) allow navigation through recently accessed buffers, without closing them.
" e) override the standard Ctrl-^ (Ctrl-6) functionality to maintain the
"    correct cursor column position. (Enable via g:BufKillOverrideCtrlCaret)
"
" The inspiration for this script came from
" a) my own frustration with vim's lack of this functionality
" b) the description of the emacs kill-buffer command in tip #622
"    (this script basically duplicates this command I believe,
"    not sure about the undo functionality)
" c) comments by Keith Roberts when the issue was raised in the
"    vim@vim.org mailing list.

" Install Details:
" Drop this file into your $HOME/.vim/plugin directory (unix)
" or $HOME/vimfiles/plugin directory (Windows), etc.
" Use the commands/mappings defined below to invoke the functionality
" (or redefine them elsewhere to what you want), and set the
" User Configurable Variables as desired.  You should be able to make
" any customisations to the controls in your vimrc file, such that
" updating to new versions of this script won't affect your settings.

" Credits:
" Dimitar Dimitrov - for improvements in mappings and robustness
" A few people who pointed out bugs I'd fixed but not made public.
" Magnus Thor Torfason - for improvements relating to the 'confirm' setting.
" Keith Roberts - for many hours of email discussions, ideas and suggestions
"   to try to get the details as good as possible.
" Someone from http://www.cs.albany.edu, who described the functionality of
"   this script in tip #622.

" Possible Improvements:
" If you're particularly interested in any of these, let me know - some are
" definitely planned to happen when time permits:
"
" - Provide a function to save window variables as global variables,
"   in order to have them preserved by session saving/restoring commands,
"   and then restore the globals to window variables with another function.
"
" - Add a mode (or duplicate to a new script) to save 'views' - where a view
"   is being at a particular place in a particular file, arrived at via
"   a buffer switch, gf or tag jump.  Allow jumping back to the previous
"   view, and kill (delete, wipe) the file when jumping back past the
"   last view in that file.

" Changelog:
" 1.11 - Mappings definition can be disabled, set g:BufKillEnableMappings to 0 to disable them
" 1.10 - Various fixes, eg relating to quicklists
" 1.9  - Remove unnecessary mapping delays, and a debug message
" 1.8  - Improved mapping handling, and robustness
" 1.7  - Minor improvements.
" 1.6  - Added (opt-in) Ctrl-^ override support to preserve cursor column
" 1.5  - Improved honouring of the 'confirm' vim option.
" 1.4  - Add buffer navigation, support for scratch buffer removal
" 1.3  - Convert to vim 7 lists instead of string-based lists
" 1.2  - Add column-saving support, to ensure returning to a buffer means
"        positioning the cursor not only at the right line, but also column,
"        and prompting the user when removing modified buffers
" 1.1  - Fix handling of modified, un-named buffers
" 1.0  - initial functionality
"
" Implementation Notes:
" w:BufKillList stores the list of buffers accessed so far, in order
"      of most recent access, for each respective window.
" w:BufKillColumnList store the list of columns the cursor was in when
"      a buffer was left.  It follows that since w:BufKillList lists
"      all buffers ever entered, but w:BufKillColumnList lists columns
"      only for those exited, the latter is expected to be one element
"      shorted than the former (since the current buffer should only be
"      entered, but not yet exited).
" w:BufKillIndex stores the current index into the w:BufKillList array

" User configurable variables {{{1
" The following variables can be set in your .vimrc/_vimrc file to override
" those in this file, such that upgrades to the script won't require you to
" re-edit these variables.

" g:BufKillCommandWhenLastBufferKilled {{{2
" When you kill the last buffer that has appeared in a window, something
" has to be displayed if we are to avoid closing the window.  Provide the
" command to be run at this time in this variable.  The default is 'enew',
" meaning that a blank window will be show, with an empty, 'No File' buffer.
" If this parameter is not set to something valid which changes the buffer
" displayed in the window, the window may be closed.
if !exists('g:BufKillCommandWhenLastBufferKilled')
  let g:BufKillCommandWhenLastBufferKilled = 'enew'
endif

" g:BufKillActionWhenBufferDisplayedInAnotherWindow {{{2
" If the buffer you are attempting to kill in one window is also displayed
" in another, you may not want to kill it afterall.  This option lets you
" decide how this situation should be handled, and can take one of the following
" values:
"   'kill' - kill the buffer regardless, always
"   'confirm' - ask for confirmation before removing it
"   'cancel' - don't kill it
" Regardless of the setting of this variable, the buffer will always be
" killed if you add an exclamation mark to the command, eg :BD!
if !exists('g:BufKillActionWhenBufferDisplayedInAnotherWindow')
  let g:BufKillActionWhenBufferDisplayedInAnotherWindow = 'confirm'
endif

" g:BufKillFunctionSelectingValidBuffersToDisplay {{{2
" When a buffer is removed from a window, the script finds the previous
" buffer displayed in the window.  However, that buffer may have been
" unloaded/deleted/wiped by some other mechanism, so it may not be a
" valid choice.  For some people, an unloaded buffer may be a valid choice,
" for others, no.
" - If unloaded buffers should be displayed, set this
"   variable to 'bufexists'.
" - If unloaded buffers should not be displayed, set this
"   variable to 'buflisted' (default).
" - Setting this variable to 'auto' means that the command :BW will use
"   'bufexists' to decide if a buffer is valid to display, whilst using
"   :BD or :BUN will use 'buflisted'
if !exists('g:BufKillFunctionSelectingValidBuffersToDisplay')
  let g:BufKillFunctionSelectingValidBuffersToDisplay = 'buflisted'
endif

" g:BufKillActionWhenModifiedFileToBeKilled {{{2
" When a request is made to kill (wipe, delete, or unload) a modified buffer
" and the "bang" (!) wasn't included in the commend, two possibilities exist:
" 1) Fail in the same way as :bw or :bd would, or
" 2) Prompt the user to save, not save, or cancel the request.
" Possible values are 'fail' (for options 1), and 'confirm' for option 2
" This is similar to the vim 'confirm' option.  Thus, if this variable
" isn't defined, the 'confirm' setting will be adopted.  Since we want
" the most current value of 'confirm', no default value need be set
" for this variable, and it needn't exist.

" g:BufKillOverrideCtrlCaret {{{2
" The standard vim functionality for Ctrl-^ or Ctrl-6 (swap to alternate
" buffer) swaps to the alternate file, and preserves the line within that file,
" but does not preserve the column within the line - instead it goes to the
" start of the line.  If you prefer to go to the same column as well,
" set this variable to 1.
if !exists('g:BufKillOverrideCtrlCaret')
  let g:BufKillOverrideCtrlCaret = 0
endif

" g:BufKillVerbose {{{2
" If set to 1, prints extra info about what's being done, why, and how to
" change it
if !exists('g:BufKillVerbose')
  let g:BufKillVerbose = 1
endif

" g:BufKillEnableMappings {{{2
" If set to 1, mappings are defined.
if !exists('g:BufKillEnableMappings')
  let g:BufKillEnableMappings = 1
